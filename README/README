Tree Manager
============
Web interface (module TreeManagerUI) for TreeManager allows creation and manipulation of multiple trees.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Apache web server (tested on version 2.2.14 in Ubuntu)

* mod_perl (tested on version 2.0.4)
** example of mod_perl startup script is located in the same folder as this README (filename mod_perl-startup.pl)
** example of virtual server configuration is located in the same folter as this README (filename apache-virtual-server)

* MySQL
** init file for table creation is located in the same folder as this README (filename database.init.sql)
!! is neccessary to set up database credentials in the module Configuration.pm

BUGS
----
Table representation of the Tree is broken in some cases.

TODO (things that I wanted to do but was pressed for time)
----
* use javascript for user input verification, currently is verification done on the server side
* create functionality for user for creation of database tables on the web UI in the case that database tables are not created yet
* improve graphic design of the UI

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS (things that could be done better)
---------------------
* better error handling in the modules Node (possibly by setting some errorId+errorMsg instead of dying)
* more abstraction in Tree and TreeStorage modules
